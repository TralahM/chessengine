WhiteKnightValid computation
============================

Remember, this is how a knight (white or black) can move:

  --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
                               
                               
          2       3            
      1               4        
              N                
      8               5        
          7       6            
                               
  --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Suppose a white knight is on a chess board like this:

  --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
                               
                               
  p   k                        
                               
      N   p   P                
              n                
  P                            
              K                
  --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

We will need the **Piece[B4]** and **AllWhitePieces** bitboards:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- |   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- |
|   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   |   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   |
|   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   |   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   |
|   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   |   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   |
|   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   |   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   |
|   0   1   0   0   0   0   0   0   |   0   1   0   1   0   0   0   0   |
|   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   |   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   |
|   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   |   1   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   |
|   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   |   0   0   0   1   0   0   0   0   |
|   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- |   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Now let's perform the function call:
WhiteKnightValid = compute_knight(Piece[B4], AllWhitePieces,
lookup_tables);

    /* LookupTables is a structure which contains all precomputed lookup tables */
    Bitboard compute_knight(Bitboard knight_loc, Bitboard own_side, LookupTables *tbls)
    {
        /* we can ignore the rank clipping since the overflow/underflow with
            respect to rank simply vanishes. We only care about the file
            overflow/underflow which is much more work for a knight. */

        spot_1_clip = tbls->ClearFile[FILE_A] & tbls->ClearFile[FILE_B];

        /* The clipping masks we just created will be used to ensure that no
            under or overflow positions are computed when calculating the
            possible moves of the knight in certain files. */

        spot_1 = (knight_loc & spot_1_clip) << 6;

**NOTE: Here we see that a shift left of 6 would have caused an
underflow when the white knight is in the left two files, so when we
mask the clip rectangle (for spot 1) against the position of the white
knight, it removes it, causing the shift to simply shift zero bits,
leaving an entire board of zeros. This means no valid move for spot
one.**
