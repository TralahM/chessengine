WhiteKingValid computation (incomplete form)
============================================

Remember, this is how a king (white or black) can move:

  --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
                               
                               
                               
          1   2   3            
          8   K   4            
          7   6   5            
                               
                               
  --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Suppose a white king is on a chess board like this:

  --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
  k                            
                               
                               
                               
                               
                      p        
              P   p            
                  K   N        
  --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

We will need the **Piece[E1]** and **AllWhitePieces** bitboard for the
above board:

|   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   |   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   |

|   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   |   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   |
|   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   |   0   0   0   1   0   0   0   0   |
|   0   0   0   0   1   0   0   0   |   0   0   0   0   1   1   0   0   |
|   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- |   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Now let's perform the function call:
WhiteKingValid = compute_king_incomplete(Piece[E1], AllWhitePieces,
lookup_tables);

    /* LookupTables is a structure which contains all precomputed lookup tables */
    Bitboard compute_king_incomplete(Bitboard king_loc, Bitboard own_side, LookupTables *tbls)
    {
        /* we can ignore the rank clipping since the overflow/underflow with
            respect to rank simply vanishes. We only care about the file
            overflow/underflow. */

        king_clip_file_h = king_loc & tbls->ClearFile[FILE_H];

**NOTE: Here we shift so far towards the least significant bit side of
the board that we shift off of the board all together trying to get to a
spot which doesn't exist. The side effect of this is that it leaves an
empty board, which is perfect, since that represents no valid moves.**
