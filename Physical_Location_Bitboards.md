Physical Location Bitboards
===========================

Real Chess Game State and Bitboards
-----------------------------------

It might not seem very obvious how exactly you use a bitboard, which
only has bits that can be either on or off, to represent a chess board
with all of the pieces on it. Well, as alluded to in the last page, you
can't. You actually need a minimum of **12** bitboards to represent the
positions of each kind and color of piece on a chessboard. These
bitboards are named: **WhitePawns, WhiteRooks, WhiteKnights,
WhiteBishops, WhiteQueens, WhiteKing, BlackPawns, BlackRooks,
BlackKnights, BlackBishops, BlackQueens,** and **BlackKing**. Each
bitboard represents one small slice of the position state of the board
and together form the big picture of a board state. So, what do the 12
initial position bitboards look like both in the chess board
visualization and the bitboard visualization?

### WhitePawns

The initial physical location bitboard for ALL of the white pawns is
this:

Commonly Needed Extra Physical Location Bitboards
-------------------------------------------------

The twelve above are the minimum needed to represent every piece on the
board. However, there are three very common bitboards that are so
useful, I'm giving them special mention: **AllWhitePieces,
AllBlackPieces,** and **AllPieces**. These boards can be derived from
the other 12 boards.

Here is the derivation of **AllWhitePieces**.

    AllWhitePieces = WhitePawns | WhiteRooks | WhiteKnights | WhiteBishops |
                        WhiteQueens | WhiteKing;

which produces a board that looks like this:

**AllBlackPieces** can be derived in the same manner:

    AllBlackPieces = BlackPawns | BlackRooks | BlackKnights | BlackBishops |
                        BlackQueens | BlackKing;

which produces a board that looks like this:

**AllWhitePieces** and **AllBlackPieces** together:

    AllPieces = AllWhitePieces | AllBlackPieces;

which produces a board that looks like this:

It turns out that these boards are **so** very useful, that instead of
deriving them like I did above, they are often kept manually updated by
the program itself.

### The Chess Board

Now we have enough information to create an actual definition for a
chess board via bitboards. It is quite simple, really:

    struct ChessBoard
    {
        /* The white piece positions */
        Bitboard WhitePawns;
        Bitboard WhiteRooks;
        Bitboard WhiteKnights;
        Bitboard WhiteBishops;
        Bitboard WhiteQueens;
        Bitboard WhiteKing;

        /* The black piece positions */
        Bitboard BlackPawns;
        Bitboard BlackRooks;
        Bitboard BlackKnights;
        Bitboard BlackBishops;
        Bitboard BlackQueens;
        Bitboard BlackKing;

        /* Commonly derived positions */
        Bitboard AllWhitePieces;
        Bitboard AllBlackPieces;
        Bitboard AllPieces;
    };

Concept of the Lookup Table
---------------------------

Now that we can define a chess board, we can start to define some useful
operations with the chess board. Some of these operations involve lookup
tables. A lookup table is a very simple entity. In its simplest form, it
is an array of precomputed values of an index number. Remember when I
said that the board symbol, like **A1** was equivalent to **bit 0** of a
bitboard and vice versa? This is where that equivalence begins to pay
off. The index into a lookup table will be either a bit position, or a
chess board position (**A1**, **B2**, etc). The returned value from the
lookup table will be a bitboard representing the all possible moves (as
if the piece was alone on the board at that position) or a bitboard
representing possible attacks (also as if the piece was alone).

The first lookup tables we will be making will be **ClearRank, MaskRank,
ClearFile,** and **MaskFile**. These represent operations which return
certain slices of the chess board. Each lookup table will have 8
entries. **ClearRank** and **MaskRank** will return bitboard that when
ANDed with another bitboard, either a rank will be removed (all bits set
to zero) or kept (all other places but that row set to zero).
**ClearFile** and **MaskFile** do the same thing, but for a file instead
of a rank--so of course there will be eight each of these as well. Here
is what they look like. The green squares represent the bits that will
be passed by the logical AND, the blue squares represent those that will
be set to zero.

This is the complete description of the lookup table of
[**ClearRank**](./table_clearrank.html).

This is the complete description of the lookup table of
[**MaskRank**](./table_maskrank.html).

This is the complete description of the lookup table of
[**ClearFile**](./table_clearfile.html).

This is the complete description of the lookup table of
[**MaskFile**](./table_maskfile.html).

Here is an example of how to use these. For example, suppose I want to
see which white pawns are in rank 3. It might be done like this:

    WhitePawnsRank3 = WhitePawns & MaskRank[RANK_3];

Let's see what this looks like visually:

-   **Step 1: An example WhitePawns**

    WhitePawns =

      --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
      0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
      0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
      0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
      0   0   0   0   0   1   0   0
      0   0   1   0   0   0   1   0
      0   1   0   1   0   0   0   1
      1   0   0   0   1   0   0   0
      0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
      --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

-   **Step 2: The lookup table entry for masking rank 3.**

    MaskRank[RANK_3] =

      --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
      0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
      0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
      0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
      0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
      0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
      1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1
      0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
      0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
      --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

-   **Step 3: Perform the mask which selects the desired pawns.**

    WhitePawnsRank3 = WhitePawns & MaskRank[RANK_3];

    |   0   0   0 |             |   0   0   0 |             |   0   0   0 |
    |    0   0    |             |    0   0    |             |    0   0    |

### The Piece Lookup Table

This lookup table is very simply a lookup table which translates a
position on a chess board to a bitboard containing a 1 on the position
marker and a zero everywhere else. This is useful to represent an
arbitrary piece alone on in a bitboard for further computation purposes,
especially when dealing with human input, e.g., a human types that they
wish to move a white pawn from d3 to d4. So, **Piece[D3]** would
represent a bitboard that you could use in the computation of where that
single piece could validly move. Here is a small example of such a
lookup table:
